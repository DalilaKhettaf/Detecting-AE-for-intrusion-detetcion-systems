# Detecting-AE-for-intrusion-detetcion-systems
Code for final year project entitled: detection adversarial examples for network intrusion detection
## Please check out the notebooks in this order:
- [Network_Intrusion_detection_system.ipynb](https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/DalilaKhettaf/Detecting-AE-for-intrusion-detetcion-systems/blob/main/Network_Intrusion_detection_system.ipynb): This notebook has the code of the intrusion detection system.
- [Boundary_attack.ipynb](https://github.com/DalilaKhettaf/Detecting-AE-for-intrusion-detetcion-systems/blob/main/Boundary_attack.ipynb)) and [HopSkipJumpAttack.ipynb](https://github.com/DalilaKhettaf/Detecting-AE-for-intrusion-detetcion-systems/blob/main/HopSkipJumpAttack.ipynb): These two notebooks have the code to generate adversarial examples with both Boundary attack and HopSkipJump attack.
- [Framework.ipynb](https://github.com/DalilaKhettaf/Detecting-AE-for-intrusion-detetcion-systems/blob/main/Framework.ipynb): This notebook has most of the code for the research work, it provides the following:
   - The code of the statistical test.
   - The code of the outlier class.
   - Codes for the three tests.
